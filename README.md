# DAMSPI
DArk Matter SPIkes (DAMSPI) is a python package for the analysis of dark matter spikes around Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) in the Milky Way. It allows to extract an IMBH catalogue and their corresponding dark matter spikes parameters from the EAGLE simulations in order to probe a potential gamma-ray signal from dark matter self-annihilation. For more details, see our published article at TBA
